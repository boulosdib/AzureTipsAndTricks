### How to log request/response payload in Application Insights for APIs frontend by API Management

#### Need for debugging/troubleshooting request/response payloads
When fronting your APIs with an Azure [API Management Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) there is often a need to debug/troubleshoot issues by analysing the request or response payload. In such a scenario we use [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/azure-monitor-app-hub?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to log and inspect the request/response payloads. To avoid performance issues at API Management level, the configuration to inspect payloads is not enabled by default.

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to trigger the sample API
* A provisioned [API Management resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance-cli#create-a-resource-group?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
* An API (with a POST operation), deployed to Azure (optional) and [frontend by API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-and-publish?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
* An Application insights resource [integrated with API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-app-insights?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
* For analyzing logs
   - Basic understanding of [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-analytics-overview#starting-log-analytics?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
   - Basic understanding of querying Application Insight tables (we will use the 'response' table)

#### Steps
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and navigate to the API Management resource
2. Under **Settings** *>>* select **API**
3. Select the sample API from the right pane
4. Click the 'Settings' tab
5. Scroll down to **Diagnostics Logs**
6. Under Application Insights tab, tick the checkbox **Enable**
7. Select the AppInsights resource under **Destination** dropdown
8. Default sampling 100%
9. Verbosity **Information**
10. Correlation protocol **W3C**
11. Under **Additional settings** click **Advanced Options**
12. Tick to enable **Frontend Request** and **Frontend Response**
13. Use these settings for **Frontend Request** and **Frontend Response**
    - Under **Headers to log** add the value **X-Forwarded-For**
    - Under **Number of payload bytes to log (up to 8192)** specify a value upto 8192 bytes
14. Hit save
15. Navigate to the application insights resource and open the 'Live Metrics' feature under **Investigate**. 
16. Once the metrics have been initialized, open Postman and trigger the POST operation for the API with a sample payload. You should see a spike in the 'request rate' graph
16. Wait for a few minutes, under Application Insights>>Monitoring>>Logs run the following query
```
requests 
| where url == "http://apimanagementurl/apiname/resource"
| where timestamp >= ago(1h)
| order by timestamp desc

```
18. In the results grid, expand the result row, expand the customDimensions node and then expand the Request-Body node.
